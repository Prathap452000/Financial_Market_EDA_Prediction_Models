üìà Tesla Stock Price Prediction & Exploratory Data Analysis
üìù Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Tesla's stock price trends and developing a predictive model using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It involves time-series analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation to forecast future stock prices with improved accuracy.

üîç Key Components
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Statistical Summary: Provides insights into the mean, median, standard deviation, and distribution of stock prices.
Time-Series Analysis: Identifies long-term trends, seasonality, and volatility in Tesla‚Äôs stock movements.
Moving Averages & Bollinger Bands: Helps detect short-term trends and price fluctuations.
Correlation Analysis: Examines relationships between stock price, volume, moving averages, and external market factors.

Stock Price Prediction
Feature Engineering:
Creation of technical indicators such as Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).
Lag-based features for time-series modeling to capture dependencies.
Scaling and normalization techniques for proper model input.

Machine Learning Models:
Linear Regression for establishing baseline predictions.
Random Forest and XGBoost for capturing nonlinear relationships.

Deep Learning Models:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), for capturing long-term dependencies in stock prices.
Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), an alternative to LSTM, for efficient time-series forecasting.

üìä Data Source
The stock price data for Tesla is obtained from publicly available data from Kaggle. Additional financial market indicators may also be incorporated to enhance the predictive power of the model.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack
Programming Language
The project is implemented using Python, which is widely used for financial data analysis and machine learning.

Data Handling
Pandas and NumPy are used for data manipulation, feature engineering, and preprocessing.

Data Visualization
Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly are utilized to create interactive charts, trend graphs, and statistical plots.

Machine Learning
Scikit-learn is used for implementing regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, providing a benchmark for stock price prediction.

Deep Learning
TensorFlow and Keras are leveraged to build LSTM and GRU-based deep learning models for time-series forecasting. These models help capture complex temporal dependencies in stock prices.

Time-Series Analysis
Statsmodels is used for statistical analysis, while Prophet, a forecasting tool developed by Facebook, may be used for predicting stock price movements.

Data Retrieval
Stock price data is retrieved using APIs like Yahoo Finance API and Alpha Vantage, allowing for real-time and historical data extraction.

Model Evaluation
Model performance is assessed using standard metrics such as:

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to measure the average prediction error.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to analyze the average absolute difference between predicted and actual stock prices.
R¬≤ Score to determine how well the model explains the variance in stock price movements.
üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
Data Collection & Preprocessing

Fetching Tesla stock price data from APIs or CSV files.
Handling missing values and outliers to ensure clean data.
Engineering new features such as moving averages and momentum indicators.

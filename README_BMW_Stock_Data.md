BMW Stock Price Prediction and Exploratory Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing BMW’s stock trends and building a predictive model using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The goal is to identify patterns in stock price movements and forecast future prices based on historical data.

Data Source
The historical stock price data for BMW is sourced from Kaggle.

Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values using forward-fill and backward-fill techniques.
Normalization and standardization of stock price data.
Detecting and handling outliers to improve model accuracy.
Feature engineering including moving averages, RSI, and Bollinger Bands.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzing stock trends and volatility over time.
Identifying correlations between stock prices, trading volume, and technical indicators.
Using visualization techniques like line plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.

Feature Engineering
Creating lag features to capture historical price patterns.
Volume-based features to analyze market activity.
Volatility measures to assess market fluctuations.

Machine Learning Models
Linear Regression for basic trend forecasting.
Random Forest to capture nonlinear dependencies.
XGBoost for improved predictive performance.

Deep Learning Models
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for capturing long-term dependencies in time-series data.
Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for improved sequential pattern recognition.

Model Training and Evaluation
Data split into training and testing sets (80-20).
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
Evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² Score.

Key Findings
Machine learning models are effective for short-term predictions.
LSTM and GRU models better capture long-term stock trends.
Moving averages, trading volume, and historical price patterns influence stock movements.

Future Enhancements
Integrating sentiment analysis from financial news and social media.
Implementing an automated trading strategy.
Deploying a real-time stock forecasting API.
